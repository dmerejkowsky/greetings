# greetings - a refactoring exercise

## Instructions

First, make sure you can see the JavaScript code in action:

```
yarn
yarn serve
```

Second, try to think about as many as different groups of people that would want
the code to change: the product owner, the localization team,
the copywriter, the front-end developers, the back-end developers, the QA team ...

Third, implement the Single Responsibility Principle. You don't need to create new classes, just new modules.


## Note

You can use `standard` to show errors and reformat the code automatically
using

```
yarn standard --fix
```
